# Axiom Corpus Data Inventory

This document catalogs data sources that have been downloaded and scraped into
the Axiom corpus. **Treat existing caches as the source of truth** — don't
re-scrape unless upstream content has changed.

**Last hand-curated:** 2026-04-16

> Status values used below:
>
> - **Complete** — parsed, ingested, and queryable. Covers the full corpus.
> - **Partial** — some content present but coverage is incomplete (missing
>   codes, subset of titles, or known gaps).
> - **Navigation-only** — we scraped the site but only captured TOC / nav
>   pages, not actual statute section text. **Not usable for queries.**
> - **Broken** — download failed (404s, empty files, or wrong MIME). **Not
>   usable.**
> - **Not started** — repo/placeholder exists but no ingestion has run.

### US states — repo exists but 0 `.yaml` files

These state repos were scaffolded but do not yet contain any encoded rules.
Content ingestion either hasn't run or hasn't produced usable output:

| Jurisdiction | Repo | Likely reason |
|---|---|---|
| AL | `rules-us-al` | Crawled; converter/ingest not run |
| AR | `rules-us-ar` | LexisNexis host; scrape captured only default pages (see below) |
| FL | `rules-us-fl` | Scrape present in `data/statutes/`; converter output empty |
| GA | `rules-us-ga` | Archive.org bulk download available; ingestion not yet run |
| MD | `rules-us-md` | Not yet scraped |
| NC | `rules-us-nc` | Archive.org bulk download available; ingestion not yet run |
| SC | `rules-us-sc` | Scrape present; converter output empty |
| TN | `rules-us-tn` | Archive.org bulk download available; ingestion not yet run |

### US states — navigation-only scrapes (NOT usable)

`data/statutes/us-{code}/` contains HTML, but the captured pages are
Tables of Contents or site navigation — **no section text was retrieved**.
These need revised crawl patterns in
`src/axiom_corpus/sources/specs/` and/or `src/axiom_corpus/crawl.py:SECTION_PATTERNS`
before re-ingesting.

| Jurisdiction | Symptom |
|---|---|
| LA | Only TOC/index pages captured |
| MN | Only navigation/UI pages captured |
| PA | Only navigation/UI pages captured |
| WA | Only navigation/UI pages captured |
| WI | Only navigation/UI pages captured |
| OK | Only index pages captured |

### US states — broken downloads

| Jurisdiction | Symptom |
|---|---|
| AK | All downloads returned 404 error pages |
| TX (`data/texas_cache/`) | Empty directory — prior crawl produced no output |

### US states — not yet scraped

Remaining state repositories are scaffolded but have no source data in
`data/statutes/` and no Archive.org mirror configured. Needs source
decisions before crawling.

## Known upstream issues

When a source is flagged broken or navigation-only, the fix usually lives
upstream or requires a revised crawl pattern rather than re-running the
existing scraper.

- **Alaska (AK)** — `akleg.gov` returns 404 pages for the patterns in
  `SECTION_PATTERNS` at `src/axiom_corpus/crawl.py`. Needs a new crawl strategy
  (likely the legislature's document server, not the public site).
- **Louisiana (LA)** — `legis.la.gov` serves statute text inside
  ASP.NET postback forms; the current crawler only captures the landing
  TOC. Needs a Playwright-based fetcher or a Public.Resource.org mirror.
- **Minnesota (MN)** — `revisor.mn.gov/statutes/` pattern matches the
  chapter browser UI, not individual sections. Needs `/statutes/cite/...`
  pattern refinement.
- **Washington (WA)** — Similar to MN; `app.leg.wa.gov` routes through a
  JavaScript-rendered TOC. Needs Playwright or the bulk RCW XML dump.
- **Wisconsin (WI)** — `docs.legis.wisconsin.gov` PDF-first delivery;
  HTML pages captured are navigation only.
- **Pennsylvania (PA)** — `legis.state.pa.us` uses dynamic
  `view-statute?...` links not currently resolved by the crawler.
- **Oklahoma (OK)** — `oscn.net` requires session cookies and
  `DeliverDocument.asp` CiteID resolution; current crawl gets index
  pages only.
- **Arkansas (AR) and Mississippi (MS)** — Both are LexisNexis-hosted.
  Archive.org has historical dumps for AR volumes but they are split
  across multiple items (not yet wired into `ARCHIVE_ORG_STATES` in
  `src/axiom_corpus/crawl.py`).

## RuleSpec source repositories

RuleSpec repos should hold manifests, registry metadata, and YAML source
materials. Do not push generated normalized source payloads to GitHub.

### Complete repositories

| Repository | Sections | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `TheAxiomFoundation/rules-us` | 60,204 | US Code USLM XML |
| `TheAxiomFoundation/rules-ca` | 601 | Canada LIMS XML |
| `TheAxiomFoundation/rules-us-dc` | 21,163 | DC Law XML |
| `TheAxiomFoundation/rules-uk` | ~3,236 | UK CLML XML |

### State repositories

See "US states" tables above for per-jurisdiction status.

## Adding new data

1. **Check this inventory first** — data may already exist
2. **Use existing scrapers** in `src/axiom_corpus/parsers/` and `src/axiom_corpus/converters/`
3. **Cache to `~/.axiom/`** for reuse across workflows
4. **Update this file** after scraping — include a status flag and date

## Converter reference

Converters in `src/axiom_corpus/converters/`:

| Converter | Input format | Output format |
|---|---|---|
| `uk_clml.py` | UK CLML XML | Axiom corpus models |
| `ca_laws.py` | Canada LIMS XML | Axiom corpus models |
| `ecfr.py` | eCFR XML | Axiom corpus models |
| `nz_pco.py` | NZ PCO XML | Axiom corpus models |
| `us_states/*.py` | State HTML/XML | USLM XML |
