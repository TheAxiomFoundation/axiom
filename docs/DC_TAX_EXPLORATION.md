# DC Tax Law Exploration for Lawarchive

**Date:** 2025-12-25
**Issue:** rules-us-mat
**Purpose:** Assess feasibility of importing DC tax law into atlas

## Executive Summary

DC is an excellent candidate for atlas import because the Council of the District of Columbia publishes their entire legal code on GitHub in structured XML format under CC0 license. This is the only jurisdiction in the world that publishes law on GitHub as an authoritative source.

**Recommendation:** Proceed with DC as the first state/territory implementation. The XML structure is well-documented and the tax code is contained in Title 47.

## XML Format Analysis

### Schema Files

The DC Council uses custom XSD schemas located in `schemas/`:

```
schemas/
├── XInclude.xsd       # XML inclusion handling
├── annotation-types.xsd  # Annotation structures
├── codified.xsd       # Codified content rules
├── codify.xsd         # Codification processes
└── dc-library.xsd     # Library-level definitions
```

### Document Structure

Sample section structure from `47-1806.03.xml` (individual income tax rates):

```xml
<section>
  <num>47-1806.03</num>
  <heading>Tax on residents and nonresidents — Rates of tax.</heading>

  <para>
    <num>(a)</num>
    <!-- Tax rate tables by effective date -->
    <para>
      <num>(10)</num>
      <text>For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2021:</text>
      <table>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Not over $10,000</td>
            <td>4%</td>
          </tr>
          <!-- Additional brackets -->
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </para>
  </para>

  <annotations>
    <!-- Legislative history, emergency amendments, cross-references -->
  </annotations>
</section>
```

## Current DC Individual Income Tax Parameters

### Tax Brackets (2022+)

| If taxable income is: | Tax = |
|----------------------|-------|
| Not over $10,000 | 4% of taxable income |
| $10,001 - $40,000 | $400 + 6% of excess over $10,000 |
| $40,001 - $60,000 | $2,200 + 6.5% of excess over $40,000 |
| $60,001 - $250,000 | $3,500 + 8.5% of excess over $60,000 |
| $250,001 - $500,000 | $19,650 + 9.25% of excess over $250,000 |
| $500,001 - $1,000,000 | $42,775 + 9.75% of excess over $500,000 |
| Over $1,000,000 | $91,525 + 10.75% of excess over $1,000,000 |

| Before 2022 | 40% of federal EITC | 47-1806.04(f)(1) |
| 2022-2024 | 70% of federal EITC | 47-1806.04(f)(1-A) |

| Out-of-State Income Tax | Dollar-for-dollar credit | 47-1806.04(a) |

## Import Strategy

### Phase 1: Direct XML Import

1. **Clone law-xml-codified repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dccouncil/law-xml-codified.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to Title 47**
   ```
   dc/council/code/titles/47/chapters/18/sections/
   ```

3. **Parse XML sections into atlas format**
   - Use existing USLM parser as template
   - Map DC XML elements to atlas models

### Phase 2: Schema Mapping

| DC XML Element | Lawarchive Model Field |
|----------------|----------------------|
| `<section><num>` | `section.citation` |
| `<heading>` | `section.title` |
| `<text>` | `section.text` |
| `<table>` | Structured data extraction |
| `<annotations>` | `section.metadata` |

### Phase 3: Parameter Extraction

Extract structured parameters from tables:

```python
# Example: Tax bracket extraction from 47-1806.03
brackets = [
    {"threshold": 10000, "rate": 0.04, "base_tax": 0},
    {"threshold": 40000, "rate": 0.06, "base_tax": 400},
    {"threshold": 60000, "rate": 0.065, "base_tax": 2200},
    {"threshold": 250000, "rate": 0.085, "base_tax": 3500},
    {"threshold": 500000, "rate": 0.0925, "base_tax": 19650},
    {"threshold": 1000000, "rate": 0.0975, "base_tax": 42775},
    {"threshold": float("inf"), "rate": 0.1075, "base_tax": 91525},
]
```

## Comparison: DC vs Federal Format

| Aspect | Federal (USLM) | DC |
|--------|---------------|-----|
| Schema | USLM XML (derived from Akoma Ntoso) | Custom XSD |
| Hosting | uscode.house.gov (download only) | GitHub (git native) |
| License | Public domain | CC0 |
| Structure | Hierarchical (Title > Chapter > Section) | Same |
| Tables | Supported | Supported |
| History | Release points | Git commits |
| API | None (must download) | Git API + web |

## Advantages of DC for Lawarchive

1. **Git-native:** No scraping needed; just `git pull`
2. **CC0 License:** Explicitly public domain
3. **Authoritative:** Official source, not a copy
4. **Structured XML:** Well-defined schemas
5. **Regular updates:** Continuous as laws are enacted
6. **Manageable size:** Single jurisdiction (not 50 states)
7. **Complete tax code:** All individual tax provisions in Chapter 18

## Challenges and Mitigations

| Challenge | Mitigation |
|-----------|------------|
| Custom schema (not USLM) | Write DC-specific parser (one-time effort) |
| Nested paragraph structure | Recursive parsing with depth tracking |
| Table extraction | Use existing patterns from federal parser |
| Amendment tracking | Use git history + annotations |
| Schema changes | Monitor law-xml-codified releases |

## Provisions to Encode First

Priority order for rules-us encoding:

1. **DC Individual Income Tax Rates** (47-1806.03)
   - 7-bracket graduated rate structure
   - Parameters: thresholds, rates, base taxes

2. **DC EITC** (47-1806.04(f))
   - Match rate to federal EITC
   - Parameters: match_rate by year

3. **DC Standard Deduction** (from OTR guidance)
   - By filing status
   - Additional amounts for age/blindness

4. **DC Child and Dependent Care Credit** (47-1806.04(c))
   - Federal credit match rate
   - Parameters: match_rate by year

5. **DC Property Tax Credit** (47-1806.06)
   - Schedule H income limits
   - Credit calculation formula

## Next Steps

1. [ ] Create DC XML parser in `src/atlas/parsers/dc/`
2. [ ] Clone law-xml-codified and test parsing
3. [ ] Add DC sections to atlas.db
4. [ ] Create catalog entries for key tax sections
5. [ ] Implement DC individual income tax in rules-us
