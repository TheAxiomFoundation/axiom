"""Citation extraction — find references in rule body text.

The extractor produces :class:`ExtractedRef` records suitable for the
``corpus.provision_references`` table. One table, two consumers:

* Axiom viewer renders body text with clickable ``<a>`` tags at the
  recorded ``(start_offset, end_offset)`` spans.
* RuleSpec tooling (axiom-encode, rules-compile) uses the outgoing refs of an
  encoded rule as the candidate list for its ``imports:`` block.

The extractor is scope-limited today to USC and CFR citation patterns —
these cover the overwhelming majority of inter-rule references in the
federal corpus. Adding a new pattern is an additive change: register a
new :class:`Extractor` subclass in :func:`all_extractors`.
