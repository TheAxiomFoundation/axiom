-- Materialized view of the jurisdiction-to-jurisdiction citation flow,
-- powering the chord/Sankey visualization on the Atlas landing page.
--
-- Exact counts require joining arch.rule_references (148k rows) against
-- arch.rules twice to resolve source + target jurisdiction. That blows
-- the PostgREST statement timeout on every call. Precompute once and
-- refresh at end of each ingest via refresh_jurisdiction_counts.
--
-- Target jurisdiction is derived from pattern_kind rather than from a
-- JOIN on target_rule_id so unresolved refs (target_rule_id IS NULL)
-- still count. The mapping is closed: each extractor emits refs into
-- exactly one jurisdiction namespace.

-- ------
-- source_jurisdiction — jurisdiction of the citing rule (e.g. 'us-ny')
-- target_jurisdiction — jurisdiction of the cited rule (e.g. 'us')
-- ref_count            — how many citations go that direction
